Thank you for playing my short demo of a Turn-Based RPG. This text file will tell you how you can play!

When loading up the game, you have three options, Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties.

Just press the button the sign tells you to press to start!
(Please note, only Easy difficulty is made right now, the other difficulties will come soon.)

You will enter the fight, and the monster will spawn!

You get two options, Fight and Item.

Press the corresponding button to use that action!

If you use fight, you will attack the enemy for a certain amount of damage.
And you have a 1/20 chance to deal a Critical Hit which deals double the damage!

The difficulty you selected will decide the amount of health you have, and the amount of damage you can do!

If you use item, you will use a Health Potion which heals a certain amount of health, depending on difficulty.

Though, be careful, you have a limited amount of items, which there will be a counter showing how many you currently have.

Upon using either action, upon pressing the "z" button, you will give the turn over to the enemy.

The enemy will then attack you, also with a chance to get a Critical Hit!

Once they attack you, press the "z" button again to have your turn again.

And once you get the enemy's HP down to zero, you win!

That is all you need to know, now be sure to have fun!
